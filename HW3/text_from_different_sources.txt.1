Fiction	He had, of course, dreamed of battles all his life--of vague and bloody conflicts that had thrilled him with their sweep and fire.
Fiction	These domestic pilgrimages were invariably in state; two maids, the private car, or Mr. Blaine when available, and very often a physician.
Fiction	The monthly nurse tried to quiet her, and presently, from exhaustion, the crying ceased.
Fiction	And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races.

Fiction	“I never did see the beat of that boy!”
Fiction	"Mercy on us, goodwife!" exclaimed a man in the crowd, "is there no virtue in woman, save what springs from a wholesome fear of the gallows?  That is the hardest word yet!
Fiction	"'Death,'" quoted Warwick, with whose mood the undertaker's remarks were in tune, "'is the penalty that all must pay for the crime of living.'"
Fiction	From his half-itinerant life, also, he was a kind of travelling gazette, carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house, so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction.
Fiction	Both were orphans, and both formed a part of Mr. Linden's household, and owed everything to his bounty.

Fiction	 In that part of the western division of this kingdom which is commonly called Somersetshire, there lately lived, and perhaps lives still, a gentleman whose name was Allworthy, and who might well be called the favourite of both nature and fortune; for both of these seem to have contended which should bless and enrich him most.

Fiction	When, therefore, intelligence was received at the fort which covered the southern termination of the portage between the Hudson and the lakes, that Montcalm had been seen moving up the Champlain, with an army “numerous as the leaves on the trees,” its truth was admitted with more of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel, in finding an enemy within reach of his blow.
Fiction	'She was brought here last night,' replied the old woman, 'by the overseer's order.
Fiction	"Isn't that an awfully obvious necktie you're wearing, Jock?" inquired his mother irrelevantly.

Fiction	My mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in the corner.
Fiction	"Oh," he answered, "you won't have heard of it!"
Fiction	I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher.

Fiction	His memories of the Boston Society Contralto were nebulous and musical.
Fiction	He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown.
Fiction	There were only the old housekeeper and her handmaiden in the house, so that on the plea of not giving too much trouble I could indulge what my other half calls my _fantaisie_ _dereglee_ as regards meals--that is to say, meals so simple that they could be brought out to the lilacs on a tray; and I lived, I remember, on salad and bread and tea the whole time, sometimes a very tiny pigeon appearing at lunch to save me, as the old lady thought, from starvation.
Fiction	“Dear, don't _think_ of getting out of bed yet.
Fiction	“Oh! of course he can’t help his hair,” admitted Rose.

Fiction	She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden.
Fiction	A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem.
Fiction	The work was toilsome, yet the periods of rest in which he indulged were not taken because of fatigue.
Fiction	"What are you eating, boy?" demanded Mr. Pett, his disappointment turning to irritability.
Fiction	I was positive now that the trailers were Apaches and that they wished to capture Powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the torture, so I urged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace, hoping against hope that I would catch up with the red rascals before they attacked him.
Fiction	"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need them," said Amy decidedly.
Fiction	"In short," concluded the parson, decisively smacking his leg with his switch, "there's hardly such another family in England."
Fiction	Down, down, down.
Fiction	These wise and sober thoughts continued all the while the storm lasted, and indeed some time after; but the next day the wind was abated, and the sea calmer, and I began to be a little inured to it; however, I was very grave for all that day, being also a little sea-sick still; but towards night the weather cleared up, the wind was quite over, and a charming fine evening followed; the sun went down perfectly clear, and rose so the next morning; and having little or no wind, and a smooth sea, the sun shining upon it, the sight was, as I thought, the most delightful that ever I saw.

Fiction	The tide was in, the wide harbor was surrounded by its dark woods, and the small wooden houses stood as near as they could get to the landing.
Fiction	The girl's face was haggard and sickly; her eyes were heavy with sleep and hunger: real Milesian eyes they were, dark, delicate blue, glooming out from black shadows with a pitiful fright.
Fiction	Curtis was supposed to be in some business downtown; but he received a liberal allowance from his uncle, and often drew upon him for outside assistance.
Fiction	My interest was first roused by talk among our guides.
Fiction	They have passed, those darky hired-men of the Midland town; and the introspective horses they curried and brushed and whacked and amiably cursed--those good old horses switch their tails at flies no more.
Fiction	 Had my circumstances permitted me, I should have answered these words by an immediate journey to Paris; but I was obliged to act by the agency of a friend, who was upon the spot, and present at the opening of the will.
Fiction	“Nothing!
Fiction	“Mind,” he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of the hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-flower--“Mind, none of us would feel exactly like this.
Fiction	Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, “That boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent to it.”
Fiction	But to-day all the sergeants in command at the various barricades had had special orders.

Fiction	“She’s got to give me some candy, then,” rejoined his young interlocutor.
Fiction	Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him, and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said to her, with a sigh, “That boy might be happy if he would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no consent to it.”
